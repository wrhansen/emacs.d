# My .emacs.d setup

## use-package

I'm not sure if this is the *best* way to do it, but I'm using the `use-package` plugin
to automatically download packages. Without it I'd have to called `package-install` on
every *require* I have in my `init.el` file. With use-package, I should now be able to
just insatll the most important amount of items 

## Package I'm Using

* all-the-icons
* org-bullets
* dashboard
* neotree
* projectile
* magit
* markdown-mode
